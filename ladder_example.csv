0,slope reps a change in both x and y values which shows there isn't an increase in just one variable.
1,I believe that it will be more than twice as it was before because if the ladder is a fixed size and the height has just increased then the distance from the wall has decreased causing the slope to have increased by more than double. 
1,The slope of the ladder is more than twice what it was before since the difference in the y direction was increased while the difference in the x direction was decreased.
0,"the equation for the first ladder is y=x+b, while the equation for the second ladder would be y=2x+b. The coefficient before the x indicates the slope and therefore the slope of the second ladder would be exactly double the slope of the first."
1,"When the rise doubles the run splits in half because we're looking at a linear function. The slope becomes inverted therefore if the slope was previously 1/2 which equals 0.5, it is now 2/1 which is equal to 2, therefore it is more than twice what it was before."
0,"I believe that the slope will not be less than or the same as the height of the top of the ladder has been changed. However, I am unsure if there is enough information to mathematically determine whether or not the ladder is exactly twice what it was before or more than twice."
0,Slope is simply twice as steep

0,slope is the rise over the run. The base is changing but the ladder is constant. The slope of 1 is less steep than the slope of 2. 
0,you adjusted a fixed object. the slope will definitely change to be steeper if it is given less space to support its weight.
1,"doubled the rise and run decreased, so the slope must be greater than twice it was before"
0,"i chose this because the height of the ladder is doubled, so the slope would be doubled aswell. "
0,"After you adjusted the ladder, the slope got steeper. Therefore if its by 2 it will be by 2"
1,"m= rise/run. The new slope is twice the original rise and less the original run. Therefore, the new m= ((2)(rise))/(smaller run) which is larger than ((2)(rise))/run."

the slope will be more than twice what it was before "
1,"If the distance of the ladder remained the same and travelled up the wall to twice the height of before, then the slope would be exactly double. Since the ladder is a fixed length, the distance from the wall decreased therefore the slop cannot be exactly double."
0,"the slope is related to x and y. The information only shows that change in y, there is no information about x. therefore, could not determine change in slope"
0,"the only information given is the change in height of the ladder (distance between floor to top of ladder), we also would need the change in width (distance between bottom of ladder to wall)"
0,"formula for a slope is y=mx+b, if x is doubled the slope should be steeper."
0,using slope (rise over run) it would logically double

1,"The length of the ladder is the exact same in both questions, and we know the relation of the height of the ladder's in both question. We can plug in actual numbers to check the slope of both questions. I made the ladder length 10m, and x = 2m. We can use the pythagorean theorem to find the length of the wall to the bottom of the ladder. If we calculate the slope, we will see that AFTER is more than double the slope of BEFORE.

0,"The height increased by 2 so the slope did as well, since it's rise increased and run decreased."
0,The slope went from x to 2x meaning that it was doubled.

0,You donâ€™t know the bottom length so you are unable to tell the slope 
0,"The height determines that the ladder doubles, as it is labeled â€œ2zâ€ which means the height has been doubled. "
0,I donâ€™t think there is enough information in the graph to see if the slope of the ladder is exactly doubled because the x axis is not labelled with any numbers so we donâ€™t know if the slop is actually half. In the graph you can see that the y-intercept is doubled.
0,"Looking at both the graphs, you can tell the approximate slope of each one by thinking about rise/run. In the first graph, the run is more than the rise which is why it isnâ€™t as steep but in graph 2 the rise is greater than the run so itâ€™s more steep. This means that the slope in graph 2 will be more than it was before. "
1,"1. Let L represent the length of the ladder, and s represent the horizontal line from the corner to where the ladder touches the ground.





before: 





s=âˆš(L^2 - x^2)





after: 





s=âˆš(L^2 - 4x^2)





2. Therefore the slopes are as follows:





mBefore = x/(âˆš(L^2 - x^2))





mAfter = 2x/(âˆš(L^2 - 4x^2))





3. Simplify mA to the following (divide out 2)





mA= x/(âˆš((L^2)/4)-x)





4. Find ratio of slopes mA/mB. Simply to the following:





ratio= (âˆšL^2 - x^2)/(âˆš(L^2)/4 - x^2))





5. For the above function, there are two limits. 0, and L/2 (L/2 is because if it was more than  that, the height would be higher than the length of the ladder, which is impossible.)





As x approaches 0, ratio approaches 2. 





âˆš(L^2 - 0)/âˆš(L^2/4 -x^2) = L/(L/2) = 2





As x approaches L/2, ratio approaches positive infinity, because the denominator would be close to 0.





Therefore, the range of the ratio of the slope is between 2 and positive infinity, so the slope of the ladder is more than twice it was before. "
0,"The scale factor is a constant, because itâ€™s continuously being multiplied by two."
0,"using the sin relation, sinðœƒ=opposite/hypotenuse, where x is the opposite and h is the hypotenuse, for the first position sinðœƒ=x/h, and for the second sinðœƒ= 2x/h. H is the same for both of them since it is the same ladder, therefore the angle of the ladder will be double what it was before and so will the slope. "
1,"When you increase the slope of the ladder, if you only moved the top (and didnâ€™t decrease the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall), the final result would have a slope of double the height. (This obviously makes no sense because the ladder couldnâ€™t reach that far). So, instead, what you do is think about the fact that the height does indeed increase on the vertical wall, but the base of the ladder also gets closer to the corner of the wall. This would then potentially imply that the slope is double the original value. The run of the slope becomes decreased, while the rise is increased. "
0,"According to Pythagorasâ€™ theorem, it is more than twice."
1,"We know that m  m=rise/run 











Now itâ€™s 2x the original rise, and 1/2 the original run.
